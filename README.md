# College-Entry-System-Data-Simulation
This project simulates a college entry system using SimPy, a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on Python. The simulation includes various entities such as applicants, interviewers, and administrative staff, and it models their interactions and processes during the college admission cycle.

# Features
  Simulation of college admission processes
  Handling of multiple applicants
  Modeling of interviews and administrative tasks
  Data generation for simulation
# Technologies Used
